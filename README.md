This project is a prototype of a multimodal notebook created for Stanford's CS 197: Introduction to Computer Science Research.

Creators: Sochima Ezema, Ashna Khetan, Steven Opferman

Mentors: Julia Markel, Michael Bernstein

## What's Special

Our notebook is unique because we have flipped the bit on traditional research surrounding
note-taking applications:
Instead of focusing on the act of writing notes, we are focusing on the interaction between one's
past notes and their current work. We have developed an enhanced application that features
split-screen content with draggable material, intelligent file suggestions, and other features
that aim to ~augment~ human productivity.

### How to run

Until we have deployed the app to github/heroku, you can access it by downloading this repo and running `npm start` to run it in your local browser @ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### What's Included

Inside src:

- components: contains all components that create the split-screen panes
- App.js: contains code to show the interactive components

No other file really matters :)

Split-screen inspiration comes from:
